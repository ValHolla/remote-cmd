This application will take a single command 
in the fashion of ssh {host} {command}
or a file containing a list of commands and login to a remote host via SSH
using RSA keys or password, and run each command.


Valid Arguments:
    -d turns on DEBUG and displays the commands sent to the client to STDOUT
    -h displays the Usage Statement and exits RC 255
    -p Causes the application to pause and prompt user to hit Enter When errors are encountered in the commands run on the client
    -v turns on Verbose mode, will display STDOUT and STDERR for each command run on the destination client.
    -s specifies skip errors that meet regexp(s) in {errfile}
    -e specifies file of environment variables to set on remote side
    -t specifies connection timeout in seconds DEFAULTS to 5 seconds
    -T {n} this will enable tracing at level 'n'
    -P This will allocate a controlling PTY on the session
    -c {command}  specifies a single command to run on the destination client
    -f {filename} specifies a file containing commands to run on the destination client
    {HOSTNAME} this is the destination client hostname or IP address

RETURN CODES:
    exits with RC 255 on a usage error
    exits with RC -1 on all other errors
    exits with RC 0 upon successful execution

Prerequisites:
    openssl http://www.openssl.org/
    libssh2 http://www.libssh2.org/

Command File Syntax:
    Commands in the command file should be 1 command per line
    you can use standard \ escaping to concatinate multiple lines into one

    These commands will follow the same rules as 'ssh {host} {command}'
    take care with nohup and backgrounding commands.

Skip File Syntax:
    Expressions in this file will not cause the script to display STDERR output
    for the commands and the -p option will be ignored if the expression
        matches any part of the STDERR output from command

    For example:
    .*mount.*  
    will cause the application to skip all STDERRs for both mount and unmount.
    like umount: {dir} not mounted
    and mount: {dir} not in fstab

    cannot remove .*: No such file or directory
       will match any standard rm error about the target not existing.
